# Let's Get Started

### 1. What you will need?

In this project, you will need:

- Web server development environment (XAMPP, LAMPP, WAMPP, etc.) In this case we use **XAMPP** and you can download [here.](<https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html>) 
- Code editor (Notepad, Notepad++, Sublime Text, VS Code) Choose one that suits you.
- A web browser. *Well, of course the one that you open to browse this repo.*
- Main file in this repository named [noteapp.zip](noteapp.zip) <- Click to redirect to download page

### 2. Setup base file

After all required files downloaded, you need to install all of it. Let the configuration of XAMPP default. After XAMPP installed, extract the zipped file into.

`C:\xampp\htdocs\`

and it should look like:
